# Bike Bucks County - Web Map

A basic webmap developed for [BikeBucksCounty](https://www.facebook.com/BikeBucksCounty/) that implements the following features:
* Filtering of features and amenities (such as Bars/Wineries, B&Bs, Attractions, Bike Shops, etc.).
* User interactivity through the [Mapbox API](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js).
* Inflation of information views regarding location, phone number, and the name of the attraction.
* Address linking to Google Maps for quick and easy routing through Google Maps.

A copy of the map can be found [here](http://offthemaps.com/bike-bucks-county-web-map) on Patrick's personal site or on the BikeBucksCounty site.
